# 0.0.5

The prototype version 0.0.5 is modification of version 0.0.2 to get closer to the Stacks 2.0 requirements. 
It is a minimal serial protocol that allows a single application to communicate with the Ryder at a time. 
The client will have to be aware of the progression of inputs depending on the initial command. 
The Ryder responds with an END sequence and features an ESC sequence for escaping both END and ESC.

## Terms
* Identity: account derived from a deterministic wallet using bip32 derivation path `m/888'/0'/n'` where `n` is the account index of the wallet.

## Commands

A list of all available commands. Note that some commands are unimplemented or disabled in prototype firmware 0.0.5. 
Other commands exist as a convenience function to ensure compatibility with the current authentication flow and will be deprecated in a later version. 
The underlying byte values are an implementation detail at this stage. Official libraries contain named constants for each of the commands in the table.

The Ryder will only accept a command when it is in a `LISTENING` state. Once a command is being processed (for example, an app sign in is requested), 
then the flow has to be completed or cancelled before the next command can be sent. 
Sending command sequences during this period my result in unexpected behaviour.

**UC**: *User Confirmation*, the command requires user confirmation.
**SI**: *Send Input*, the Ryder can request additional input follow the command.
*****: Will require user confirmation in the future. 

#### `COMMAND_INFO`

Returns basic information about the device as a byte sequence in the following format: `ryder[version major][version minor][version patch]0[initialised status]`. The `ryder` string at the start is static.

#### `COMMAND_RESTORE_FROM_MNEMONIC`

A single byte should follow the command that specifies the number of words in the mnemonic. The number should be `12`, `18`, or `24`. Any other value results in a `RESPONSE_ERROR_MNEMONIC_INVALID` response.

After the Ryder responds with `RESPONSE_SEND_INPUT`, a phrase of 12, 18, or 24 words in the order specified on the device should be sent as ASCII. The words may be separated by a space (dec `32`) or a null byte (dec `0`). The final word should also be terminated by a null byte. To abort the restore, pass an "empty" word by sending a double null byte.

#### `COMMAND_EXPORT_PUBLIC_IDENTITY`

A single byte should follow the command that specifies the identity number to export. The count is zero-based. The first identity is thus identified by `0`. 

#### `COMMAND_EXPORT_APP_*` and `COMMAND_EXPORT_OWNER_APP_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`

A single byte should follow the command that specifies the identity number to to use. The count is zero-based. The first identity is thus identified by `0`.

The Ryder will then respond with `RESPONSE_SEND_INPUT`, after which the app domain URL including the protocol (`https://`) should be sent to the device as ASCII. The app domain has to be terminated by a null byte (dec `0`). The response is an ASCII string with the following format: `[app domain],[app public key],[app private key],[owner private key]`, depending on the chosen export command.

#### `COMMAND_EXPORT_DERIVED_PUBLIC_KEY`

Eleven bytes should follow the command that specify the path according to bip32. The first byte defines the number of path segments. A maximum of 5 path segments is supported.
Each path segment is defined by two bytes. If first bit of the first byte is set, the child is hardened. 
Example: `m/44'/5757'/0'/0/0` translate to `[5, 128, 44, 150, 125, 128, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

The Ryder will then respond with `RESPONSE_WAIT_USER_CONFIRM`. If the user confirms the export request, 
Ryder responds with start byte, the public key of the requested account, closed by the end byte.

#### `COMMAND_REQUEST_TRANSACTION_SIGN`

The Ryder will then respond with `RESPONSE_SEND_INPUT`, after which the account index as one byte, the transaction length as four bytes 
and the raw transaction should be sent to the device. 

The Ryder will then respond with `RESPONSE_WAIT_USER_CONFIRM`. If the user confirms the sign request, the Ryder responds with start byte, 
the signed transaction and the end byte.

#### `COMMAND_REQUEST_MESSAGE_SIGN`

#### `COMMAND_REQUEST_JWT_HASH_SIGN`

## Responses

These are all the possible responses from Ryder prototype firmware version 0.0.5.

| Name | Dec | Short description | IR |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `RESPONSE_OK` | `1` | Generic command ok/received. | Y |
| `RESPONSE_SEND_INPUT` | `2` | command received, send input. | Y |
| `RESPONSE_REJECTED` | `3` | The user rejected the request. | N |
| `RESPONSE_OUTPUT` | `4` | Start of output sequence. | Y |
| `RESPONSE_OUTPUT_END` | `5` | End of output. | N |
| `RESPONSE_ESC_SEQUENCE` | `6` | Output escape sequence. | N |
| `RESPONSE_WAIT_USER_CONFIRM` | `10` | The user is prompted for confirmation. | Y |
| `RESPONSE_LOCKED` | `11` | Device is locked, send PIN. (Unimplemented.) | / |

**IR**: *Initial Response*, the Ryder can immediately respond with this sequence after receiving a command.

Once the `RESPONSE_OUTPUT` sequence is received, the client should expect the Ryder to output data of arbitrary length that ends with `RESPONSE_OUTPUT_END`. If the data contains a byte value equal to `RESPONSE_OUTPUT_END` or `RESPONSE_ESC_SEQUENCE`, it will be preceded by `RESPONSE_ESC_SEQUENCE`. The client should keep reading until it encounters a `RESPONSE_OUTPUT_END` that is not preceded by `RESPONSE_ESC_SEQUENCE`.  It should then remove any escape sequences before processing the data.

Public keys and addresses are output as ASCII readable strings. Private keys are likewise output as hexadecimal strings.

## Error responses

In addition to the responses above, the Ryder may respond with one of the following error codes. Some error codes are specific to one or more commands.

| Name | Dec | Short description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | `255` | The received command byte does not relate to any known command. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_NOT_INITIALISED` | `254` | The Ryder is not initialised with a wallet. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_MEMORY_ERROR` | `253` | The Ryder encountered a memory error while processing the command or input. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_APP_DOMAIN_TOO_LONG` | `252` | The provided app domain is too long to be processed. This error code precedes the memory error code. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_APP_DOMAIN_INVALID` | `251` | The app domain does not start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_MNEMONIC_TOO_LONG` | `250` | The provided mnemonic phrase is too long to be processed. This error code precedes the memory error code. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_MNEMONIC_INVALID` | `249` | The mnemonic phrase has an invalid word count or the checksum failed. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_GENERATE_MNEMONIC` | `248` | The Ryder could not generate a mnemonic phrase of the desired strength. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_INPUT_TIMEOUT` | `247` | The client waited too long with sending input. (Unimplemented.) |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | `246` | Prototype response code to indicate that the current feature is still being worked on. |
| `RESPONSE_ERROR_TRANSACTION_TOO_LONG`| `245` | Transaction can't be handled because of its size. The maximum size is 4096 bytes.|
